Question 1

Create a program that tells you whether or not you need an umbrella when you leave

the house.

The program should:

1. Ask you if it is raining using input()

2. If the input is 'y', it should output 'Take an umbrella'

3. If the input is 'n', it should output 'You don't need an umbrella'


ðŸ’¡ weather = input(â€™Is it raining?â€™)

is_raining = raining  == â€˜Rainingâ€™

print(â€™It is raining: {}â€™ .format(is_raining))



Question 2

I'm on holiday and want to hire a boat. The boat hire costs Â£20 + a refundable Â£5

deposit. I've written a program to check that I can afford the cost, but something

doesn't seem right. Have a look at my program and work out what I've done wrong

my_money = input('How much money do you have? ')

boat cost = 20 + 5

if my_money < boat_cost:

print('You can afford the boat hire')

else :

print('You cannot afford the board hire'


ðŸ’¡ < is not supported in uses of string and intergers.



Question 3

Your friend works for an antique book shop that sells books between 1800 and 1950

and wants to quickly categorise books by the century and decade that they were written. Write a program that takes a year (e.g. 1872) and outputs the century and decade (e.g. "Eighteenth Century, Seventies")

Question 1

I have a list of things I need to buy from my supermarket of choice.

`shopping_list = [`

`"oranges",`

`"cat food",`

`"sponge cake",`

`"long-grain rice",`

`"cheese board",`

`]`

`print(shopping_list[1])`

I want to know what the first thing I need to buy is. However, when I run the program

it shows me a different answer to what I was expecting? What is the mistake? How

do I fix it.


ðŸ’¡ 1 is not the first number on a list item as it starts with 0. So it should be `print(shopping_list[0])` to get the first item on the list.



Question 2

 I'm setting up my own market stall to sell chocolates. I need a basic till to check the

prices of different chocolates that I sell. I've started the program and included the

chocolates and their prices. Finish the program by asking the user to input an item

and then output its price.

`chocolates = {`

`'white': 1.50,`

`'milk': 1.20,`

`'dark': 1.80,`

`'vegan': 2.00,`

`}`

Question 3

Write a program that simulates a lottery. The program should have a list of seven

numbers   that   represent   a   lottery   ticket.   It   should   then   generate   seven   random

numbers. After comparing the two sets of numbers, the program should output a

prize based on the number of matches:

Â·         Â£20 for three matching numbers

Â·         Â£40 for four matching numbers

Â·         Â£100 for five matching numbers

Â·         Â£10000 for six matching numbers

Â·         Â£1000000 for seven matching numbers

Question 1

You're having coffee/tea/beverage of your choice with a friend that is learning to

program in Python. They're curious about why they would use pip. Explain what

pip is and one benefit of using pip.


ðŸ’¡ PIP is a package that comes installed with Python after version 3.4. It can be installed if not already using the terminal. It allows you to install and manage other packages that arenâ€™t a part of Pythons standard set.



Question 2

This program should save my data to a file, but it doesn't work when I run it. What

is the problem and how do I fix it?

poem = 'I like Python and I am not very good at poems'

with open('poem.txt', 'r') as poem_file:

poem_file.write(poem)


ðŸ’¡ The poem is set to read mode. It needs to be amended like -

`with open('poem.txt', 'w') as poem_file:`



Question 1

In this session you used the PokÃ©mon API to retrieve a single PokÃ©mon.

I want a program that can retrieve multiple PokÃ©mon and save their names and moves to a file.

Use a list to store about 6 PokÃ©mon IDs. Then in a for loop call the API to retrieve the data for

each PokÃ©mon. Save their names and moves into a file called 'pokemon.txt'

Question 2 (optional)

Here is a link to a really cool API: https://opentdb.com/

Answer the following questions:

Â·        What is the name of this API?


ðŸ’¡ Open Trivia datasbase



Â·        What does it do?


ðŸ’¡ Itâ€™s an API that generates user input trivia questions.



Â·        Example URL to make a call to this API?
