Question 2
 
You are leading a development team that was given a task to create a new yoga 
booking system.
High level description of the system is as follows:
 
·        It has a very simple interface to accept user input (bookings) and display 
classes information
·        All bookings, appointments, schedules etc should be stored in a SQL 
database.
·        There is a ‘backend’ system that should be written in Python to handle the 
logic and manage the data flow. 
Your team has two weeks to build a simple prototype that will be shown to the 
client to seek their feedback and discuss further enhancements.
 
TASK
·        Break this task into smaller stories (chunks of work) for the team to work 
on.
·        Assume that one person works on one task.
·        Mark tasks that can be worked on in parallel and perhaps those that need 
to be worked on in particular order.

TASK 2 (SQL)
Question 1
Design a cinema booking system.
Think how you would approach the problem and what are potential ways of solving 
it?
You do not need to write actual code, but describe the high-level approach:
·        Draw a list of key requirements
·        What are your main considerations?
·        What would be your common or biggest problems?
·        What components or tools would you potentially use?
·        You are welcome to draw a diagram (a very simple one) for the process flow 
to explain how  it is going to work. 

Requirements - List of available movies, seating, UI with colours for available seats, 
data input for customer details, ability to cancel booking, display records of bookings, mandatory fields - seats/customer details. 

Considerations - making a user account to keep details and make sure name/contant is required

Biggest problems - if details aren't required, places booked with no confirmation (email for confirmation etc), cancellations
current movie list/screening locations so nothing is booked that isnt available.
