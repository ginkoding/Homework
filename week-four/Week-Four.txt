Question 1
Complete definitions for key Git & GitHub terminology
GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS
·        Working Directory is the checkout location of a folder, usually the .git  folder. You cannot git add 
from outside the root directory and git status compares current and one in the cloud. In general it is the area before staging 
a commit. 
·        Staging Area is when you prepare your work for a commit. You can still make changes int he staging area and 
it has not been commited yet but needs doing before a commit. 
·        Local Repo (head) is the project being worked on, on your local computer. Changes are not commited on 
github (yet) and many people can work on their own local repo's for the same project at the same time. Then merge them 
all together with a commit.
·        Remote repo (master) is the main repository that everyoe working on a project commits too. It collects 
and merges all the various files and allows for version control. If something goes wrong, it is possible to pull back to a different version 
or amend a branch before adding it to the master branch to remove conflicts. 
 
WORKING DIRECTORY STATES:
·        Staged is marked for commiting, not yet commited. 
·        Modified is edited from the main .git repository in the cloud and on a local machine.
·        Committed a modified file that has been merged into git for other to pull down and amend on their own local repos. 
 
GIT COMMANDS:
·        Git add - moves a modified file into the staging area using the terminal
·        Git commit - commit changes but not yet in the remote repo. Often paied with -m "relevant message"
·        Git push - usually used with origin to specify a branch to push to on the remote repo
·        Git fetch - like git pull but doesnt create a copy, so it doesnt affect any local files. 
·        Git merge - merge two branches, usually one section merged into the main once complete
·        Git pull - pull remote repo to local working directory, make it up to date
