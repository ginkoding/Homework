# TASK 2 (Exception Handling)

# Question 1
# Simple ATM program
# Using exception handling code blocks such as try/ except / else / finally, write a program that simulates an ATM machine to withdraw money.
# (NB: the more code blocks the better, but try to use at least two key words e.g. try/except)
# Tasks:
# 1.       Prompt user for a pin code
# 2.       If the pin code is correct then proceed to the next step, otherwise ask a user to type in a password again. You can give a user a maximum of 3 attempts and then exit a program.
# 3.       Set account balance to 100.
# 4.       Now we need to simulate cash withdrawal
# 5.       Accept the withdrawal amount
# 6.       Subtract the amount from the account balance and display the remaining balance (NOTE! The balance cannot be negative!)
# 7.       However, when a user asks to ‘withdraw’ more money than they have on their account, then you need to raise an error an exit the program.


# TASK 3 (Testing)

# Question 1
# Use the Simple ATM program to write unit tests for your functions.
# You are allowed to re-factor your function to ‘untangle’ some logic into smaller blocks of code to make it easier to write tests.
# Try to write at least 5 unit tests in total covering various cases.
